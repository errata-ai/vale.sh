# TextFSM

Learn how to lint plain text that has structure but no markup.

A commit message is a subject, a blank line, a body, and trailers. A subtitle file is a run of cues, each an index, a timing, and a line or two of text. A transcript is a series of turns, each opened by a name. None of that is markup, so Vale reads such a file as lines, and a rule has no way to say “the subject” or “the model’s turn.”

A `textfsm` [View](../topics/views.md) fixes that. It reads the file through a template in the form Google’s [TextFSM](https://github.com/google/textfsm/wiki/TextFSM) defined for parsing the output of network devices: a list of named values, then a state machine whose rules are regular expressions. What the template captures becomes [scopes](../topics/scopes.md), each placed at the line and column it came from, so a rule reaches the subject the way it reaches a heading and its alert lands where the text is.

Vale runs the template itself. Nothing needs installing, and the patterns use the same [regex](regex.md) dialect as every rule.

## A first template

Take the commit message. Three parts of it deserve rules of their own: the subject, the body, and the trailers at the end.

```
fix: report the shortfall at the scope that fell short.

Zero matches leave no occurence to point at, but the scope has a
position of its own.

The View lives at `<StylesPath>/config/views/Commit.yml`:

```yaml
engine: textfsm
template: |
  Value Subject (.+)
  Value List Body (.*)
  Value List Trailer ([A-Z][\w-]+: .+)

  Start
    ^${Subject} -> Body

  Body
    ^# -> Next
    ^${Trailer}
    ^${Body}
scopes:
  - name: subject
    expr: Subject

  - name: body
    expr: Body
    type: md

  - name: trailer
    expr: Trailer
```

Read the template from the top:

* Three `Value` lines declare what to capture: a name and the pattern that fills it. `Subject` keeps one line. `Body` and `Trailer` are `List` values, which keep every line they capture rather than the last.
* `Start` is the state reading begins in. Its one rule matches the first line, captures it as the subject, and moves to the `Body` state.
* In `Body`, each line is tried against the rules in order, and the first to match wins. A line starting with `#` is Git’s own commentary, and `-> Next` reads past it without capturing anything. A trailer looks like `Word: text`, so it’s tried next; anything else is body.

`${Subject}` stands for the value’s pattern and captures what it matches. The `->` says what happens on a match; a rule without one reads the next line in the same state.

The `scopes` then name the values to lint. `subject` and `trailer` are linted as plain text. `body` has `type: md`, so it’s parsed as Markdown and a rule scoped to `body` sees paragraphs and inline code the way it does in a `.md` file.

Wire the View to the file in `.vale.ini`. Sections match by path, so a file without an extension is fine:

```ini
[COMMIT_EDITMSG]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, House

View = Commit
```

A rule reaches a scope by name:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "A subject line doesn't end with '%s'."
level: error
scope: subject
raw:
  - '\.$'
```

And the alerts land in the file, not in the value:

```
 COMMIT_EDITMSG
 1:55  error  A subject line doesn't end with '.'.  House.Subject
 3:23  error  Did you really mean 'occurence'?      Vale.Spelling
```

In a `commit-msg` hook, the message arrives on stdin. `--path` tells Vale which section applies:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
vale --path=COMMIT_EDITMSG < "$1"
```

## How a template is read

![The template as a state machine: Start moves to Body on a line matching Subject, capturing it; Body stays in Body on a Trailer or Body line, capturing one each; the record is emitted at the end of the file and each value becomes a scope.](../.gitbook/assets/textfsm-states.svg)

A template has two parts. The values come first, one per line, up to the first blank line. Each is `Value [options] Name (pattern)`, and a line starting with `#` is a comment. The states follow: a state is a name at the left margin, and its rules are the indented lines beneath it. Every template needs a `Start` state; `End` and `EOF` are reserved.

In the View’s YAML, the template is a block scalar (`|`), so backslashes in patterns need no escaping, and the indent under a state name is what marks a line as a rule.

Reading is one line at a time. The current state’s rules are tried in order, and the first to match decides what happens next. A line no rule matches is skipped: it captures nothing, the state stays the same, and the line lands in no scope.

A rule is `^pattern -> action`, where the action is any of the following, and `Line.Record` pairs are joined with a dot:

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Next` | Read the next line. The default. |
| `Continue` | Keep trying the rules below against the same line. A `Continue` rule can’t change state. |
| `Record` | Emit the captures in hand as a record and start a fresh one. |
| `NoRecord` | Emit nothing. The default. |
| `Clear` | Drop the captures in hand, except `Filldown` values. |
| `Clearall` | Drop every capture, `Filldown` values included. |
| `Error "message"` | Stop reading. Vale reports the message as an error against the View and exits. |
| A state name | Enter that state. `End` stops reading. |

On a match, the line’s captures are assigned first, then the record action runs, then the state changes. So a rule that both captures and says `Record` puts that line’s captures into the record it emits, and `Continue.Record` emits before the rules below capture into the fresh one.

The options on a `Value` line change what it keeps:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `List` | Every capture, in order, rather than the last one. |
| `Filldown` | The last capture carries into the next record until a new one replaces it. |
| `Required` | A record missing this value is dropped rather than emitted. |

`Key` and `Fillup` are accepted for compatibility with TextFSM and change nothing.

A record is emitted for each `Record` action, and the captures in hand at the end of the file are emitted as one more, `End` included. So a template that never says `Record` yields one record per file. An `EOF` state replaces that last record: `EOF` with a `^.* -> Record` rule keeps it, and `EOF` with no rules discards it.

In a pattern, `${Name}` or `$Name` stands for the value’s pattern and captures what it matches. Everything outside it is matched but not captured, which is how `^user: ${User}` keeps the label out of the scope. Start each rule with `^`, as TextFSM does; a rule without it matches anywhere in the line.

## From captures to scopes

Each scope’s `expr` names one of the template’s values, and Vale reports an error at startup if it doesn’t. The scope’s `name` is what a rule’s `scope` refers to, and `type` says how to parse the captured text: `md`, `adoc`, `html`, `rst`, or `org`. Without a `type`, the text is linted as plain lines.

Consecutive lines a `List` value captures are joined into one block, so a body reads as the paragraphs it is rather than one block per line. A gap between the lines starts a new block, and so does a change of column: a block is placed by one line and one column, so every line in it has to start where its first line does. Two values captured after labels of different lengths, such as a `msgid` and a `msgstr`, never share a column and so never join, and a rule that needs both in one block matches nothing without saying why. Capture each whole line, label included, and they align at the first column.

The blank line matters here. `(.*)` matches a blank line and captures it as empty, so the block continues and the paragraph break survives. `(.+)` doesn’t match a blank line, so the block ends and the next captured line starts another. For a body with `type: md`, `(.*)` gives one document with paragraphs, and `(.+)` gives one document per paragraph. Rules that count across a document, such as `occurrence` and `repetition`, see the difference.

A `textfsm` View takes the file over. A file the section matches is read by the template, whatever its extension, even when it’s `.md`. Only the values a scope names are linted; the rest of the file is never seen by a rule, unless the rule’s scope is `raw`, which still reads the whole file.

## One record per unit

A subtitle file is a run of cues, each an index, a timing line, and one or more lines of text, separated by blank lines. Only the text is prose:

```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
First cue, one line.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Second cue,
which wraps.
```

The template walks a cue in three states, and the blank line that ends one emits a record and returns to `Start` for the next:

```yaml
engine: textfsm
template: |
  Value Index (\d+)
  Value Timing (\d\d:\d\d:\d\d,\d\d\d --> \d\d:\d\d:\d\d,\d\d\d.*)
  Value List Cue (.+)

  Start
    ^${Index}$ -> Timing

  Timing
    ^${Timing}$ -> Cue

  Cue
    ^$ -> Record Start
    ^${Cue}
scopes:
  - name: cue
    expr: Cue
```

`Index` and `Timing` are captured so that the template can tell where it is, but no scope names them, so no rule ever sees a timestamp. A rule scoped to `cue` runs over the text of each cue, and a two-line cue is one block at the line and column its first line starts on.

## One side of a conversation

A transcript alternates between a user and a model, and only one side is yours to lint:

```
user: Summarize the change in one line.
assistant: The linter now reports where a scope fell short.
It's worth noting that this only affects occurence rules.
user: Thanks, that's clear enuf.
```

A turn runs until the next label, so each state needs to know when the turn is over before it knows whose turn comes next:

```yaml
engine: textfsm
template: |
  Value List Assistant (.*)
  Value List User (.*)

  Start
    ^assistant: ${Assistant} -> Assistant
    ^user: ${User} -> User

  Assistant
    ^(?:user|assistant): -> Continue.Record
    ^assistant: ${Assistant}
    ^user: ${User} -> User
    ^${Assistant}

  User
    ^(?:user|assistant): -> Continue.Record
    ^user: ${User}
    ^assistant: ${Assistant} -> Assistant
    ^${User}
scopes:
  - name: assistant
    expr: Assistant
    type: md
```

The first rule in each state is the trick. It matches any label, captures nothing, emits the turn in hand as a record, and continues, so the rules below it capture the new turn into a fresh record. A line with no label is a continuation of whichever turn is open.

`User` is captured so the prompt’s lines have somewhere to go, but no scope names it, so the misspelling on the last line goes unreported:

```
 transcript.txt
 3:6   error  'worth noting' hedges, and this is the model's turn.  House.Assistant
 3:42  error  Did you really mean 'occurence'?                      Vale.Spelling
```

The column is the column of the capture, so an alert on the first line of a turn points past the label.

## Seeing what a template captured

A template can be right and still surprise you, because a line no rule matches vanishes without a word. The quickest way to see what a scope holds is a rule that reports every line of it:

```yaml
extends: existence
message: "captured '%s'"
level: suggestion
scope: cue
nonword: true
raw:
  - '(?m)^.+$'
```

Run with `--output=line` and each captured line is listed at its position:

```
sample.srt:3:1:Probe.Cue:captured 'First cue, one line.'
sample.srt:7:1:Probe.Cue:captured 'Second cue,'
sample.srt:8:1:Probe.Cue:captured 'which wraps.'
```

The `(?m)` matters: a block of joined lines is one value, and without the multiline flag `^` and `$` only match at its ends.

Delete the rule once the template does what you expect.
