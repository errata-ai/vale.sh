# BlockIgnores

Learn how to define custom block-level ignores in your Vale configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
`BlockIgnores` are supported in AsciiDoc, HTML, Markdown, MDX, MyST, Org Mode, QDoc, Quarto, reStructuredText, and Typst. MyST, QDoc, Quarto, and Typst require Vale v3.18.0 or later; HTML requires v3.21.0 or later.

They work by wrapping each match in the format's block code delimiter, so they need a markup format to wrap it with. In a source code file they have no effect—but associating a markup format with your comments makes them available. See [Code](../formats/code.md#associations).
{% endhint %}

```ini
StylesPath = styles

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale

BlockIgnores = (?s) *({< file [^>]* >}.*?{</ ?file >})
```

`BlockIgnores` allow you to exclude certain block-level sections of text that don’t have an associated HTML tag that could be used with [`SkippedScopes`](skippedscopes.md).

The idea is to write a regular expression that captures the entire block in the first grouping. Several patterns are separated by commas, so a comma inside a pattern is written `\,`. See this [regex101 session](https://regex101.com/r/mFM0kZ/1/) for a more thorough explanation.

A section can be keyed on a path as well as an extension, which narrows the patterns to one part of the project:

```ini
[docs/api/*.md]
BlockIgnores = (?s)(<!-- generated -->.*?<!-- /generated -->)
```

The pattern matches the file as Vale was asked for it, so write it relative to where you run Vale. See [Globbing](../guides/globbing.md).
