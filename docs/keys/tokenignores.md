# TokenIgnores

Learn how to define custom inline-level ignores in your Vale configuration.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`TokenIgnores` are supported in AsciiDoc, HTML, Markdown, MDX, MyST, Org Mode, QDoc, Quarto, reStructuredText, and Typst. MyST, QDoc, Quarto, and Typst require Vale v3.18.0 or later; HTML requires v3.21.0 or later.

They work by wrapping each match in the format's inline code delimiter, so they need a markup format to wrap it with. In a source code file they have no effect—but associating a markup format with your comments makes them available. See [Code](../formats/code.md#associations).
{% endhint %}

```ini
StylesPath = styles

[*.rst]
BasedOnStyles = Vale

TokenIgnores = (:math:`.*`), (:ref:`.*`)
```

`TokenIgnores` allow you to exclude certain inline-level sections of text that don’t have an associated HTML tag that could be used with [`IgnoredScopes`](ignoredscopes.md).

The idea is to write a regular expression that captures the entire token in the first grouping. Several patterns are separated by commas, so a comma inside a pattern is written `\,`. See this [regex101 session](https://regex101.com/r/3Raecd/1) for a more thorough explanation.

A section can be keyed on a path as well as an extension, which narrows the patterns to one part of the project:

```ini
[docs/api/*.md]
TokenIgnores = (\{\{[^}]+\}\})
```

The pattern matches the file as Vale was asked for it, so write it relative to where you run Vale. See [Globbing](../guides/globbing.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Dollar math needs no `TokenIgnores`: `$x^2$` and `$$…$$` are ignored in Markdown, Quarto, MyST, and MDX. See [Math](../formats/markdown.md#math).
