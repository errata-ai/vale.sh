/**
 * Five extension points, each with a rule a pattern match could not write.
 * Not rendered anywhere at present; kept for an extension-points page.
 *
 * These five were chosen against one question: could a regular expression do
 * this? None of them can. `sequence` needs a part-of-speech tagger,
 * `conditional` needs a second pattern found elsewhere in the file,
 * `consistency` needs to remember what it already saw, `metric` is arithmetic
 * rather than matching, and `script` is a program. The token-list rules people
 * think of as "all Vale does" are the other seven, in rule-examples.ts.
 *
 * Every rule, sample, and alert below was produced by running Vale v3.17.0
 * over the sample text with that exact rule. The alert messages and levels are
 * its output, not paraphrases of it.
