| Name         | Type     | Description                                                               |
| :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ignorecase` | `bool`   | Makes all matches case-insensitive.                                       |
| `first`      | `string` | The antecedent of the statement.                                          |
| `second`     | `string` | The consequent of the statement.                                          |
| `vocab`      | `bool`   | If false, disables all active vocabularies for this rule (default: true). |
| `exceptions` | `array`  | An array of strings to be ignored.                                        |

```yaml
extends: conditional
message: "'%s' has no definition"
level: error
scope: text
ignorecase: false
# Ensures that the existence of 'first'
# implies the existence of 'second'.
first: '\b([A-Z]{3,5})\b'
second: '(?:\b[A-Z][a-z]+ )+\(([A-Z]{3,5})\)'
# ... with the exception of these:
exceptions:
  - ABC
  - ADD
```

For example, consider the following text:

> According to Wikipedia, the World Health Organization \(WHO\) is a
> specialized agency of the United Nations that is concerned with international
> public health. We can now use WHO because it has been defined, but we can't
> use DAFB because people may not know what it represents. We can use `DAFB`
> when it's presented as code, though.

Using the above text with our example rule yields the following:

```bash
test.md:1:224:style.UnexpandedAcronyms:'DAFB' has no definition
```

`conditional` also takes an optional `exceptions` list. Any token listed as an
exception won't be flagged.

## Lookarounds

Regular expression lookarounds can be used to restrict the capture of the
rule, allowing for more complex conditional statements. For example, the
following rule will flag any MDX-style import that is not used:

```yaml
extends: conditional
message: "'%s' has been imported but not used."
level: error
scope: raw
first: "(?<=import )(\w+)(?= from)"
second: '(?<=<)(\w+)'
```
