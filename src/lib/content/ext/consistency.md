| Name         | Type    | Description                                                       |
| :----------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nonword`    | `bool`  | Removes the default word boundaries \(`\b`\).                     |
| `ignorecase` | `bool`  | Makes all matches case-insensitive.                               |
| `either`     | `array` | A map of `option 1: option 2` pairs of which only one may appear. |

`consistency` will ensure that a key and its value
\(e.g., "advisor" and "adviser"\) don't both occur in its scope.

```yaml
extends: consistency
message: "Inconsistent spelling of '%s'."
level: error
ignorecase: true
# We only want one of these to appear.
either:
  advisor: adviser
  centre: center
```
