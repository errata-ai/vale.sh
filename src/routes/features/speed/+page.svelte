		<p class="mt-6 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/85">
			Format moves this number more than corpus size does. Markdown Vale parses itself, at about 7
			ms a page. reStructuredText and AsciiDoc go first through the tools that define them—Docutils
			and Asciidoctor—and Vale holds those open for the whole run instead of starting one per page,
			which is most of the difference between 53 ms and 128 ms a page here and what those
			conversions used to cost. Rule count matters second: Docker runs fourteen rules, GitLab
			eighty-two.
		</p>
		<p class="mt-8 text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/85">
			Every rule ran against every page—no sampling, no incremental cache. Each project links to its
			own docs and config above, so any of these is reproducible with one command.

			The shapes differ because the policies do. GitLab reserves <code
				class="rounded bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 font-mono text-[0.85em]">error</code
			>
			for a single thing across 2,826 pages and lets the rest inform; Docker puts most of its findings
			there. Neither is wrong—the level is set per rule, so the decision about what stops a build gets
			made once, in the rule, instead of being argued over in review.

			Going from one style guide to five adds 90 ms. Most of even that is the one-time cost of
			loading and compiling the rules, paid on every CLI invocation—which is why the language
			server, which pays it once and then keeps the styles in memory, can re-lint as you type.
