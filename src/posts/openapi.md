[OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) files provide machine-readable (JSON or YAML) descriptions of APIs and often contain snippets of text suitable for linting.

The problem is that the target text can be hard to reach from a linting perspective. For instance, consider the following basic example from Swagger's Petstore:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: sample API
  description: Optional multiline or single-line description in [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/help/) or HTML.
  version: 0.1.9

servers:
  - url: http://api.example.com/v1
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Main (production) serrver
  - url: http://staging-api.example.com
    description: |
      Optional server description, e.g.
      Internal staging serrver for testing
  - url: http://api.example.com/v2
    description: Optional server description, e.g. Main (production) serrver

paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: Returns a list of users.
      description: Optional extended description in CommonMark or HTML.
      responses:
        '200': # status code
          description: A JSON array of user names
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
```

As you can see above, the only parts we're really interested in are the `title`, `description`, and `summary` keys — the human-readable prose embedded in an otherwise machine-readable file.

When this article was [originally written in 2019](https://medium.com/valelint/vale-the-openapi-specification-8a7cfae135fb), reaching that content required scripting workarounds, format conversion tools, or accepting poor error reporting. Vale now has a first-class solution for this problem: [**Views**](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/views).

## What are Views?

A _View_ is a virtual, filtered perspective of a structured file. It defines a series of transformation steps that extract specific, named content from a file, effectively changing how the file is represented for linting purposes. This means Vale can lint exactly the fields you care about — and nothing else — with accurate file locations reported for any errors found.

Views support two engines. [Dasel](https://github.com/TomWright/dasel) queries structured data (JSON, YAML, and TOML), and [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) does the same for source code — see the [documentation](https://docs.vale.sh/topics/views) for the full picture. An OpenAPI document is structured data, so we'll be using Dasel here.

Views are stored in `<StylesPath>/config/views` as YAML files and referenced in your `.vale.ini` under any syntax-specific section. One useful pattern is to attach a View to a specific named file rather than an extension glob, which lets you apply different Views to different documents even if they share the same file extension:

```ini
StylesPath = styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion

[*.{yml,yaml}]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, Scopes

[API.yml]
View = OpenAPI
```

Here, all YAML files are linted normally, but `API.yml` additionally uses the `OpenAPI` View to extract only the prose fields.

## Setting up a View for OpenAPI

Here's a View that targets only the fields we want to lint in our OpenAPI document:

```yaml
engine: dasel
scopes:
  - expr: info.title
    name: title

  - expr: 'search(has("description")).map(description)'
    name: description
    type: md

  - expr: 'search(has("summary")).map(summary)'
    name: summary
    type: md
```

Save this file as `<StylesPath>/config/views/OpenAPI.yml`.

Each scope works as follows:

- `expr` is a [Dasel query](https://github.com/TomWright/dasel) that selects the data to lint. Dasel is a query tool for structured data formats like JSON and YAML.
- `name` assigns a metascope to the extracted values, which lets you write rules that target a specific field — for example, enforcing a character limit only on `title` values — independently of other scopes.
- `type` tells Vale how to interpret the extracted content. Setting it to `md` means embedded Markdown links and formatting are handled correctly rather than flagged as errors (`adoc`, `html`, `rst`, and `org` are also supported). The `title` scope has no `type` because our API titles are plain text — and a scope without a `type` uses its `name` as the value's only scope, which is what the rule in the next section hooks into.

The `search(has("description")).map(description)` expression deserves a closer look. Rather than manually enumerating every path in the document where a `description` field might appear — `info.description`, `servers[*].description`, `paths[*][*].description`, `paths[*][*].responses[*].description`, and so on — `search` recursively traverses the entire document tree and finds every node that contains a `description` key, regardless of nesting depth. The `.map(description)` call then extracts the string value from each matched node.

This makes the View future-proof: if your spec adds `description` fields in new locations like `components` or `parameters`, they are picked up automatically without any changes to the View. See the [Dasel v3 docs](https://daseldocs.tomwright.me/functions/search) for more information.

## Writing a scoped rule

Our configuration enables a style named `Scopes`, and this is where the View's `name` fields pay off. A rule can target one extracted field and ignore the rest:

```yaml
# styles/Scopes/TitleCase.yml
extends: existence
message: 'API titles start with a capital letter.'
level: error
scope: title
nonword: true
tokens:
  - '^[a-z]'
```

The `scope: title` line is the connection. The View names the values it extracts, and the rule opts into exactly one of them — descriptions and summaries are never checked against it.

## Running Vale

With the View in place, run Vale as you normally would:

```console
$ vale --output=line API.yml
API.yml:3:10:Scopes.TitleCase:API titles start with a capital letter.
API.yml:4:25:Vale.Spelling:Did you really mean 'multiline'?
API.yml:9:70:Vale.Spelling:Did you really mean 'serrver'?
API.yml:13:24:Vale.Spelling:Did you really mean 'serrver'?
API.yml:15:70:Vale.Spelling:Did you really mean 'serrver'?
exit=1
```

That's real output, and it shows the two halves working together. The `title` rule fired exactly once, on the title. Every location points into the original YAML file — including line 13, where the misspelling sits inside a multiline (`|`) block scalar. Nothing outside the View's three scopes was checked at all: no false positives from URLs, keys, or status codes.

## Conclusion

Views are the cleanest way to lint OpenAPI Specification files with Vale. By expressing your document's structure as a series of targeted Dasel queries, you get accurate error reporting, full Markdown support, and no external scripts or format conversion steps.
